# Handling Missing Data in Machine Learning

## Introduction

This script demonstrates how to handle missing data in a dataset using two different techniques. Missing data is a common issue in real-world datasets, and how we handle it can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models. This code demonstrates two popular methods for filling missing values:

1. **Forward Fill Method**
2. **Filling with the Most Frequent Value (using SimpleImputer from the sklearn library)**

## Application in Machine Learning

In machine learning, handling missing data is a critical step in data preprocessing. Most machine learning algorithms cannot work with missing data, and it is essential to ensure that complete data is provided for model training. Therefore, choosing the right method to fill in missing values can have a significant impact on prediction accuracy and model performance.

The two methods demonstrated in this script are:

1. **Forward Fill:** This method is useful when the data is sequential or time-series based (e.g., time-series data), assuming that the previous data point is a good estimate for the missing value. This technique is particularly useful when missing values are lost in a time sequence.

2. **Filling with the Most Frequent Value:** This method is useful when missing data is random, and we assume that the most frequent value in a column is a good representation of the missing values. This method is commonly used for categorical data.

Using these techniques allows us to train machine learning models on complete datasets, leading to more accurate predictions.

## Conclusion

Handling missing data is an important step in data preprocessing for machine learning. By using different techniques to fill missing values, we ensure that our data is suitable for training machine learning models. In this script, we explored two methods for filling missing data: **Forward Fill** and **Filling with the Most Frequent Value**.

## How to Use

1. Place your dataset (the `NullDATA.csv` file) in the project directory.
2. Run the script to display the data after applying the different missing value filling methods.
3. Modify the code to suit your dataset and preferred missing value filling strategies.
